Left click to start a shape or place a vertex for a shape you have started. If that vertex finishes the shape, it closes the shape and fills it in.

Right click to see the right-click menu.

	Shapes - Choose the shape you would like to create next.
		Alternatively press QWERTY to select shapes.
		
	Colors - Choose the color for the next vertex you create.
		Alternatively press 1-9 to select colors.
		
	Point Size - Choose the size of the next point you create.
	
	Line Width - Choose the thickness of the next line you create.
	
	Clear - delete all shapes.
	
	Exit - exit the program.
		Alternatively press Esc to exit.

While selecting vertices, transparent lines will draw toward the mouse. These are a preview of the shape and color if you create a vertex there.

Some shapes do not have a specific number of vertices. Click Space or Enter to finish these shapes.
